# Flight-Probability-Analyzer
The code is a simple Python program that analyzes flight data stored in a JSON file and calculates the probability of having at least six flights of more than 700 km in each month of the year. The program uses the Poisson distribution to calculate these probabilities, and the results are printed to the console.
